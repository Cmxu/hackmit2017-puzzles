Puzzle 5
========

You made it, it's the final puzzle and it's all about CAPTCHAS. The basic premise of this task is that you will need to solve CAPTCHAS, in fact, you will need to solve at least 10000 of them in order to pass. This puzzle is unlike the others in the sense that the goal is not hidden, but it is hard in the sense that there is no set way to do this problem. So below I will provide a brief overview of some of the techniques we know about that worked.

| Technique   | Comments                                                                                                                |

| Brute Force | For the Masochists. The contest is over, it's not worth it anymore.                                                     |
| Hashing     | A quick solution if you can find it, but not too satisfying in my opinion.                                              |
| OCR         | [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/) is good at this, but it requires a lot of work to achieve good accuracy. |
| cNN         | Convolutional Neural Networks. This is it what we use in our solution below.                                            |
