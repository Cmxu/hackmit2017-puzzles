HackMIT 2017 Puzzle Solutions
=============================

This repository contains a writeup of our code/thinking throughout solving the puzzles for HackMIT 2017. The puzzles are hosted at [delorean.codes](https://delorean.codes). We started the puzzles at 5pm on Monday, June 3rd and finished them 11pm on Wednesday, June 5th. They were extremely fun (as in we literally were unable to do anything else, like our research, until we finished them), and I would recommend you check them out ourself before peeking at our solutions.

Important Note
--------------

We are not the creators of these puzzles and these are not the official solutions by any means. We would like to thank the creators for creating such interesting puzzles and putting the time in to host this small contest.
